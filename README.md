### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am William Jian, a software developer that recently graduated from General Assembly's Software Engineerings Immersive Program. Working in the customer service industry, I want to apply my knowledge and skills to bring a more pleasant User Experience into all my code.
- Iâ€™m currently working on adding more icebox features to my stock-tracker app.
